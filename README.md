# Ghost AI ðŸ‘¾

The game map is represented as a 2D array where each cell has either a `0` or `1`. `0` represents a wall and `1` is a traversable path. This 2D array is what gets passed to the `A*` function which returns an array of steps the ghosts should follow to reach Pac-Man. The function uses the A* algorithm to find the best path for the ghosts to take.
 
Since Pac-Man's position is constantly changing, we only need to get the first step from the array of steps and move the ghost. The path that the ghosts take is highlighted by tracing the path returned by the A* function.
